# Arduino-Says
Simon Says eletronic game running on an Arduino board.

## About The Project
This was my first experience playing around with an Arduino board. I decided this would be a fun game to try making since my resources were fairly limited in terms of electronic components.
It was also the first time I used a breadboard or did anything related to circuits other than 10th grade classes so the circuit is kind of a mess.

## The Game
The game is played just like the classic Simon Says game (1-player only), the CPU generates an increasingly longer random sequence and the player has to repeat it.
Since I wasn't familiar with the original device and it's rules, I've given the player 3 chances at failing, I find it a cool feature so I'll probably keep it.
